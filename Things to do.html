        <h1>Things to do</h1>
        <p>Seeing the bulk of New York City's biggest attractions can mean spending a hefty chunk of a trip's budget on tickets. Empire State Building? $27. The Met? $25. The Guggenheim and the Whitney go for $22 and $20, respectively. Even the Frick is $20. But there's a lifetime of fun to be had without ever handing over a cent, and not just by taking on park trails, bike paths or window browsing.</p>
          
       <h2>1. African Burial Ground:</h2>
 <p>One of Lower Manhattan's most fascinating, and controversial, stories of recent years circulates around the new African Burial Ground National Monument site. It began when a construction project in 1991 uncovered a burial ground of slaves – more than 400 caskets were found – from an age when New York had more slaves than any American city outside Charleston, South Carolina. Outside you can see part of the site now enveloped by buildings, and the compact visitors center does a masterful job at retelling African-American history in the city. See our 76-Second Travel Show episode on the museum's opening. 290 Broadway between Duane & Elk Sts, Lower Manhattan.</p>
          
        <h3>2. Chelsea galleries:</h3>
<p>New York's most concentrated area for a gallery crawl is in Chelsea, mostly in the 20s Streets between 10th and 11th Avenues. Check westchelseaarts.com or Gallery Guide for listings. All are free, no pressure to buy. And try timing for wine-and-cheese openings on Thursday evenings.</p>
          
        <h4>3. Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) Museum:</h4>
<p>It's always Fashion Week in the FIT Museum, which features rotating exhibits by students and a surprisingly interesting and detailed collection of the country's first gallery of fashion, picked from a collection of 50,000 garments dating from the 18th century to present. Seventh Ave & 27th St, Garment District, Midtown West.</p>
          
         <h5>4. Federal Reserve Bank of New York:</h5>
 <p>Reserve at least a week ahead to visit the Federal Reserve Bank, most rewarding just to ogle the facility's high-security vault – useful considering more than 10,000 tons of gold reserves reside here, 80ft below ground. There's also exhibits on counterfeit currency as well as a serious coin collection of the American Numismatic Society. A tour (six daily, Monday-Friday excluding bank holidays) is the only way to get in. 33 Liberty St, Lower Manhattan.</p>
          
         <h6>5. Forbes Collection:</h6> 
<p>The lobby galleries of Forbes magazine have some various curios from the late Malcolm Forbes' collection, most notably early versions of Monopoly boards. (Or watch our tour of Monopoly sites around the properties' namesakes at Atlantic City, New Jersey.) 62 Fifth Ave at 12th St, Greenwich Village.</p>
          
         <h7>6. General Ulysses S Grant National Memorial (aka 'Grant's Tomb'):</h7> 
<p>Also called 'Grant's Tomb', the $600,000 granite structure that holds the remains of the Civil War hero and 18th president (and his wife Julia) is the largest mausoleum in the US, and is patterned after Mausolus' tomb at Halicarnassus, making it a plagiarized version of one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Riverside Dr at 122nd St, Morningside Heights.</p>
          
         <h8>7. Governor's Island:</h8> 
<p>The ferry to Governor's Island is free, as is access to the 172-acre island which opened to the public only in 2003. There's a 2.2-mile bike path, mini golf, a picnic area, plus military sites such as Admiral's House and a 'ghost town' of sorts at Nolan Park. Ferries leave from Battery Maritime Bldg, Slip 7, Lower Manhattan.</p>
          
          <h9>8. Grand Central Partnership Walking Tours:</h9>
<p>Two historians lead free 90-minute walking tours at 12:30pm every Friday, hitting places like Grand Central Terminal's 'whispering gallery' and the Chrysler Building. 120 Park Ave, at 42nd St, Midtown East.</p>
          
          <h10>9. Green-Wood Cemetery:</h10>
<p>Once the nation's most visited tourist attraction outside Niagara Falls, the gorgeous Green-Wood Cemetery was founded in 1838 and is the eternal home to some 600,000 people (or about 530 miles of bodies, head to toe). It's leafy and lovely, features Brooklyn's highest point at Battle Hill, a site from the Revolutionary War, now marked with a seven-foot statue of the Roman goddess of wisdom, Minerva. Watch for the squawking green parakeets at the cemetery's Gothic entry - these are runaways from a JFK mishap in 1980 and have lived here since. 500 25th St, Sunset Park, Brooklyn.</p>
          
         <h11>10. Hamilton Grange:</h11>
 <p>You know you're important when you get a grange. This one, Hamilton Grange, reopened in 2011 after renovation, is the Federal-style country retreat where Alexander Hamilton spent quieter, pre-death-by-duel New York days. St Nicholas Park at 141st St, Hamilton Heights.</p>
          
         <h12>11. New York Earth Room:</h12> 
<p>Now for something completely different: the Earth Room, Walter De Maria's 1977 art installation, a single room filled with 280,000 pounds of dirt, combines the framework of an ordinary office with the scent of a wet forest. 141 Wooster St, SoHo</p>
          
        <h13>12. Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture:</h13> 
 <p>Part of the city's library system, the country's largest collection of documents, books, recordings and photographs related to the African-American experience, the Schomburg Center also hosts free exhibits and self-guided tours. Guided tours are also free, but must be booked at least one month in advance. 515 Malcolm X Blvd at 135th St, Harlem.</p>
